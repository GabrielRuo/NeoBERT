# NeoBERT

## Description

NeoBERT is a **next-generation encoder** model for English text representation, pre-trained from scratch on the RefinedWeb dataset. NeoBERT integrates state-of-the-art advancements in architecture, modern data, and optimized pre-training methodologies. It is designed for seamless adoption: it serves as a plug-and-play replacement for existing base models, relies on an **optimal depth-to-width ratio**, and leverages an extended context length of **4,096 tokens**. Despite its compact 250M parameter footprint, it is the most efficient model of its kind and achieves **state-of-the-art results** on the massive MTEB benchmark, outperforming BERT large, RoBERTa large, NomicBERT, and ModernBERT under identical fine-tuning conditions.

## Get started

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install transformers torch xformers==0.0.28.post3
```

If you would like to use sequence packing (un-padding), you will need to also install flash-attention:

```bash
pip install transformers torch xformers==0.0.28.post3 flash_attn
```

## How to use

Load the model using Hugging Face Transformers:

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "chandar-lab/NeoBERT"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)

# Tokenize input text
text = "NeoBERT is the most efficient model of its kind!"
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate embeddings
outputs = model(**inputs)
embedding = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]
print(embedding.shape)
```
